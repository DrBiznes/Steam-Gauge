# Steam Gauge

Your personal Steam library analyzer and game discovery tool. Steam Gauge helps you explore Steam's vast gaming landscape through interactive challenges and data-driven insights. <Note number={1}>This project was inspired by my fascination with Steam's public APIs and the wealth of data available about gaming trends and player behavior.</Note>

## The Challenges

At its core, Steam Gauge offers two distinct gaming experiences designed to test your knowledge of gaming trends and Steam's vast library.

### Gauge-ing Game

The first challenge puts your intuition about game popularity to the test. Can you guess which game has better Steam reviews? <Note number={2}>Review scores are calculated based on the ratio of positive to negative reviews, making it a fascinating measure of player satisfaction rather than just raw popularity.</Note>

Here's how the scoring system works:

<CodeBlock title="Score Calculation" language="typescript" collapsed={false}>{`function calculateScore(positive: number, negative: number): number {
  const totalReviews = positive + negative;
  if (totalReviews === 0) return 0;
  
  return Math.round((positive / totalReviews) * 100);
}`}</CodeBlock>

### Cover Artfuscation

The second challenge tests your knowledge of game visuals. You'll see a pixelated game cover that becomes clearer with each wrong guess. <Note number={3}>The pixelation effect is achieved using HTML Canvas and clever image manipulation, allowing for smooth transitions between different levels of clarity.</Note>

Here's a glimpse at how we handle the pixelation:

<CodeBlock title="Pixelation Effect" language="typescript" collapsed={true}>{`const pixelateImage = (
  ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  image: HTMLImageElement,
  canvas: HTMLCanvasElement,
  pixelSize: number
) => {
  const w = canvas.width;
  const h = canvas.height;

  // Draw original image
  ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, w, h);

  if (pixelSize > 1) {
    const tempCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const tempCtx = tempCanvas.getContext('2d');
    tempCanvas.width = w;
    tempCanvas.height = h;

    if (tempCtx) {
      tempCtx.drawImage(ctx.canvas, 0, 0);
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, w, h);
      
      // Create pixelation effect
      const sw = w / pixelSize;
      const sh = h / pixelSize;
      
      ctx.drawImage(tempCanvas, 0, 0, w, h, 0, 0, sw, sh);
      ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
      ctx.drawImage(canvas, 0, 0, sw, sh, 0, 0, w, h);
    }
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

## Technical Stack

Steam Gauge is built with modern web technologies, emphasizing performance and user experience. <Note number={4}>The entire application is built using React and TypeScript, ensuring type safety and better developer experience.</Note>

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with:
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Zustand for state management

Here's an example of our state management setup:

<CodeBlock title="Game State Management" language="typescript" collapsed={true}>
{`export interface GameState {
  leftGame: Game | null;
  rightGame: Game | null;
  revealed: boolean;
  isTransitioning: boolean;
}`}
</CodeBlock>

### API Integration

The application interfaces with multiple Steam APIs to gather game data. <Note number={5}>We use a combination of the Steam Store API and SteamSpy API to gather comprehensive game information, including review scores, player counts, and metadata.</Note>

## Design Philosophy

The project's design philosophy emphasizes:
1. Clean, minimal interfaces
2. Smooth animations and transitions
3. Responsive design that works on all devices
4. Clear feedback for user actions

<Note number={6}>The UI design draws inspiration from Steam's dark theme while incorporating modern design principles and smoother animations.</Note>

## Future Plans

We're constantly working on improving Steam Gauge with new features and refinements. Some upcoming additions include:
- More game modes focused on different aspects of Steam games
- Enhanced social features for sharing scores
- Additional game metadata and statistics
- Expanded genre coverage and filtering options
