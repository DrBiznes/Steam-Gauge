# About Steam Gauge

I made two games.
Rather fascinating ones, if I do say so myself. <Note number={1}>The whole thing is powered by a delightful combination of the Steam Store API and SteamSpy API, with a dash of AllOrigins as our CORS proxy?</Note>
 They're built atop Steam's rather marvelous collection of APIs, which I've wrangled into something properly entertaining. 
You see, whilst tinkering with Steam's vast data repositories (as one does), I discovered there's something rather compelling about turning all these numbers and metrics into proper challenges. The first tests your ability to gauge which games have earned more acclaim from Steam's notoriously particular reviewers. The second, well, that's a bit of visual puzzle where you'll need to identify games through increasingly less pixelated images. Quite clever, if you don't mind me saying.

Getting all the data to work together was a right faff at first, like trying to herd cats in the rain. But I got there in the end, and now it's smooth as silk. The APIs chuck out everything I need: player counts, reviews, the lot. Dead handy once you've got your head round it.

## How The Hing Works

Right then, let me tell ye how this whole contraption works. Pure dead brilliant when ye think about it. Been coding since before they put the cone on the Duke of Wellington's head, so trust me when I say this setup's a proper bobby dazzler.

### The APIs

I've got two APIs daein all the heavy lifting, right:

1. **The SteamSpy API** - Pure class this one, gives me aw the numbers I could want. Player counts, review scores, the lot
2. **Steam's ain Store API** - Dead fancy, tells me everything else aboot the games. What they're about, when they came oot, that kind of thing

Now, browsers can be proper awkward buggers about talking tae these APIs directly - like trying tae get into the Garage without a ticket. So I've got this thing called AllOrigins that sorts it. Take a look at how I sweet talk the data oot of SteamSpy <Note number={2}>Built in some retry logic an' all, cause sometimes these APIs can be about as reliable as the Glasgow weather.</Note>

<CodeBlock title="API Request Handler" language="typescript">{`async function getSteamSpyGames(request: string, params: Record<string, string> = {}): Promise<Game[]> {
  // See whit we're after
  const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({ request, ...params })
  const steamspyUrl = \`\${STEAMSPY_API}?\${queryParams}\`
  const url = \`\${CORS_PROXY}\${encodeURIComponent(steamspyUrl)}\`
  
  // Gonnae no dae that? Gonnae dae this instead
  const response = await fetchWithRetry(url)
  const data = await response.json()
  
  // Sort oot the good stuff fae the mince
  const gamesArray = Object.values(data) as SteamSpyGame[]
  const validGames = gamesArray
    .map(convertSteamSpyGame)
    .filter(game => 
      game.steamScore > 0 && 
      game.totalReviews && game.totalReviews > 500 &&
      game.name &&
      game.steamId
    )

  return validGames // There ye go, sorted
}`}</CodeBlock>

Dead simple when ye break it doon like that. The code's just asking nicely for the data, waiting till it gets what it wants (tries a few times if it has tae), then makes sure everything's proper before sending it back. Like a bouncer at the Barrowlands, but for data.

### Zustand

Right, let's talk about how I keep track of everything. I'm using this wee thing called Zustand - pure magic for keeping all yer data in order. <Note number={3}>Proper simple tae use but mighty powerful under the hood, like a souped-up Vauxhall Corsa.</Note>

Think of it like the big score board at Hampden Park it keeps track of who's winning, who's playing, and what's happening in the game. Let me show you what my setup looks like under the bonnet:

<CodeBlock title="Zustand Store" language="typescript">{`export const useGaugeStore = create<GaugeStore>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      currentMode: null,
      currentGenre: null,
      isLoading: false,
      gameModeStates: {} as GameModeStates,

      setGameMode: (mode: GameMode, genre?: string) => {
        const currentStore = get()
        const modeKey = mode === 'genre' ? \`genre-\${genre}\` : mode
        
        const existingState = currentStore.gameModeStates[modeKey]
        const newModeState = existingState || createInitialModeState()
        const needsGames = !existingState || !newModeState.gamePool.length === 0

        set({
          currentMode: mode,
          currentGenre: genre || null,
          isLoading: needsGames,
          gameModeStates: {
            ...currentStore.gameModeStates,
            [modeKey]: newModeState
          }
        })
      }
    }),
    {
      name: 'game-storage',
      partialize: (state) => ({
        gameModeStates: Object.fromEntries(
          Object.entries(state.gameModeStates).map(([key, value]) => [
            key,
            {
              highScore: value.highScore || 0,
              currentScore: value.currentScore || 0
            }
          ])
        )
      })
    }
  )
)`}</CodeBlock>

Looks like a right mouthful, but it's pure straightforward once ye get yer head round it. Keeps track of yer high scores even when ye close the browser - saves them tae local storage, like putting yer favorites in the pub's till for next time. The whole thing's more organized than my maw's kitchen cupboards, and twice as clever.

## The Games

Right then, let me tell ye about these two wee games I've cobbled together.

### Gauge-ing Game

Here's the first yin - ye've got tae figure out which game's got the better reviews on Steam. Pure tricky this one, because the SteamSpy API disnae just give me a nice score - naw, it chucks a pile of positive and negative reviews at me, and I've got tae work it out myself. <Note number={4}>I take all the thumbs up and thumbs down, add them up and work out the percentage. Makes it fair for games that have thousands of reviews against ones that only have hundreds.</Note>

Let me walk you through how I crunch the numbers

<CodeBlock title="Score Calculation" language="typescript">{`function calculateScore(positive: number, negative: number): number {
  const totalReviews = positive + negative
  if (totalReviews === 0) return 0
  
  return Math.round((positive / totalReviews) * 100)
}

async function makeGuess(position: 'left' | 'right'): Promise<void> {
  const store = get()
  const modeKey = store.currentMode === 'genre' 
    ? \`genre-\${store.currentGenre}\` 
    : store.currentMode!

  const modeState = store.gameModeStates[modeKey]
  const leftScore = modeState.leftGame.steamScore
  const rightScore = modeState.rightGame.steamScore

  const isCorrect = (position === 'left' && leftScore > rightScore) ||
                   (position === 'right' && rightScore > leftScore)

  // Update score and continue game...
}`}</CodeBlock>

### Cover Artfuscation

Fer the second game, I'm playing a wee bit of hide and seek with Steam's game covers. Take these fancy high-resolution images from the Steam Store API, run them through my special wee image mangler, and bob's yer uncle - ye've got yerself a proper guessing game. <Note number={5}>The real magic's in the Canvas API - lets me mess about with the pixels like I'm playing with a digital Etch A Sketch, making everything nice and smooth-like when I change the blur.</Note>

I use the Canvas API to pixelate the images. Magic is whats it is

<CodeBlock title="Pixelation Effect" language="typescript">{`const pixelateImage = (
  ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  image: HTMLImageElement,
  canvas: HTMLCanvasElement,
  pixelSize: number
) => {
  const w = canvas.width
  const h = canvas.height

  // Draw original image
  ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, w, h)

  if (pixelSize > 1) {
    const tempCanvas = document.createElement('canvas')
    const tempCtx = tempCanvas.getContext('2d')
    tempCanvas.width = w
    tempCanvas.height = h

    if (tempCtx) {
      tempCtx.drawImage(ctx.canvas, 0, 0)
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, w, h)
      
      // Create pixelation effect
      const sw = w / pixelSize
      const sh = h / pixelSize
      
      ctx.drawImage(tempCanvas, 0, 0, w, h, 0, 0, sw, sh)
      ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false
      ctx.drawImage(canvas, 0, 0, sw, sh, 0, 0, w, h)
    }
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

Pure poetry in motion, that code. Takes yer pristine image, chops it up intae wee squares, then puts it back together like a jigsaw puzzle that's had a few too many pieces enlarged. Each time ye guess wrong, I make those squares a bit smaller, and the picture gets that wee bit clearer. It's like when yer granny's trying tae tune in the telly, except I'm doing it with purpose, ken?

## Tech Stack

Right, let me tell ye about what makes this hing tick. We've got [React](https://react.dev) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) doing the heavy lifting, with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) making everything look proper smart. [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion) keeps it all moving smooth-like, while [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) keeps track of everything like a well-organized bookie. Topped it off with [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query) tae handle all our API shenanigans.


## Acknowledgments

Listen, we couldnae have done any of this without a few crucial bits and bobs. First off, big thanks tae [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/) for the Steam platform and their APIs - without them we'd just be staring at an empty screen like it was the last train home. Pure grateful to the [SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/) team an' all - their data's been more reliable than a Glasgow taxi driver in the rain.

And we cannae forget the folks at [AllOrigins](https://allorigins.win/) <Note number={6}>I'm no entirely sure if using a CORS proxy is the right way to go about this, but it's working for now. If you're from Valve or AllOrigins reading this and you're no happy about it, just give us a shout and we'll sort something else out.</Note> without their proxy service, we'd be stuck trying tae get these APIs talking to each other like trying tae arrange a night out in a WhatsApp group. Never happening, but they sorted it right out.
